        <h2 id="recipe-1">Recipe #1 Rosti potato</h2>
        <!-- This is a relatively easy and tasty recipe. It is usually served as a guarnishment to a protein but can also be the main dish! Also, the filling used in this rosti is optional, you can change it to whatever you like, this one is just an idea -->

        <p class="step"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cook the potatoes by putting them in a large pan with water to the top. When the water starts boiling, leave them for 5 minutes and then take them off.
</p>
        <p class="step"><strong>Step 2:</strong>In a large bowl, pour some cold water and ice and leave the potatoes there until they are at room temperature again.
     </p>   
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the meantime, cut the bacon slices into small bits and cook them with olive oil on a hot pan until they have a golden appearance.
     </p>  
     <p class ="step"><strong>Step 4:</strong> After the potatoes have cooled down, use a peeler to remove their peel.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now use a shredder to shred the potatoes into threads. Use the large part of the shredder so that they don't come out too small and separate all potato shreds into two bowls of the same quantity.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final and most important steps, it's best to use a pan with more depth (like a frying pan, but with a deeper bottom). After pouring a little olive oil on the pan's surface, take the shredded potatoes from one of the bowls and arrange them nicely to cover the whole bottom of the pan.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 7:</strong> Season the shredded potatoes on the pan with the desired amount of salt and pepper- just remember that you will do this again with the other portion of potatoes- and add all of the bacon and cheese on top of the first layer. </p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 8:</strong>Close the rosti by using the other half of potatoes to cover it and start a medium-low fire. If it is too big for the pan, press it lightly to minimize space taken. Season the top layer of potatoes with salt and pepper as well.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 9:</strong>After 3 to 4 minutes, use a very large plate to place on top of the pan as to close it. Then, turn the rosti upside down in a quick movement so that it doesn't break. From the plate, place the rosti back on the pan to fry the side that hasn't been fried yet.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 10:</strong>Finally, after frying the other side for a few minutes too, use the same large plate to place the rosti and serve it. Enjoy!</p>

     <p class="step"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place all chicken upperlegs in a very large bowl and wash them (to remove impurities).</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 2:</strong>First, put some salt and pepper on the chicken. Even though it is to taste, it's important to <em>not put too little</em> as salt and pepper are what brings the chicken to its signature taste at the end.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now squeeze the juice from half of a lemon onto the upperlegs, mositurizing all of them. If necessary, massage the upperlegs to distribute the salt, pepper and lemon juice better.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Grind the two garlic cloves onto the bowl and pour half a bottle of beer into it as well. Mix those ingredients with your hands with delicacy.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 5:</strong> To finish the seasoning, pull the leaves off the rosemary stems and mix them lightly with the chicken.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 6:</strong> Leave the bowl to set for at least 45 minutes. During this time, the upperlegs will soak into the mixture of seasonings, beer and lemon, giving it a nice and sophisticated taste. The more time left, the tastier the chicken will be at the end. You can even leave it overnight and only bake it the next day for great flavour!</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 7:</strong> After leaving the upperlegs to embed the mixture, it is time to bake them. You can even do this using the same bowl depending on its material. Pre-heat the oven for 220 degrees.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 8:</strong> When the oven is already heated, put the bowl with the upperlegs and close the oven. This step will take around 40 minutes, but it is always good to check every 10 to 10 minutes.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 9: </strong>After cooking the chicken, if your oven has a grill function, turn it on for 5 to 10 minutes. If not, remain it in the oven until it is not raw inside anymore (it is best when well done).</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 10:</strong> Serve while still hot with guarnishments. Enjoy!</p>

     <h3>Egg whites</h3>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, to make the fluffy and light egg whites, separate the yolk from the white in each egg. You can do this using a certain kitchen tool, or with the eggshell itself.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pour all the whites into a stand mixer and start mixing them (batedeira).</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 3: </strong>Mix in a high intensity and keep checking every 15-30 seconds how the whites are. The correct point is when the whites look homogenous/foamy, if you turn the mixer upside down, they don't fall. You can also pull the mixer's fouet up to see if the whites form small peaks. If they already do these then stop mixing! If you mix them for too long they start secreting water that can't be dissolved into the whites anymore.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add 3/4 cups of sugar and mix it <em>delicately</em> within the whites. If you don't, they might overpass the right consistency. It is suggested to do this with a spatula at a slow but steady rythm. Taste the whites to see if you want them to be more sweet or if you think they are already good.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 5: </strong>After the egg whites are finished, use an empty cup or large spoon to form the "islands". They should look like small, irregular balls of egg whites, which you will place above parchment paper on an oven pan and leave them in the oven for 2-4 minutes so that they get a golden crust. Your islands are finished! Now it's time to make the cream, which is the "sea" to your islands! In portuguese this cream is called <em>creme inglês</em>.</p>
     <h3>Egg yolks</h3>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Now that the yolks have been separated, put them all in a bowl and mix with the sugar that's left, which adds up to 8 tablespoons. You can mix with a spoon or a fouet as long as it becomes a homogenous mixture. </p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pour 700 ml of milk into a pan with depth and dissolve the vanilla extract while it is on a medium to low fire. If the milk stays for too long in the heat, it will start to clog- what we call, in portuguese, <em>nata</em>.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Take a small fraction of the hot milk and pour it into the bowl with the yolks to mix them delicately until they get roughly homogenous. This is to avoid the yolks getting cooked in the next step.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 4:</strong> In a <em>low</em> fire, pour the yolk and milk mixture into the pan with the rest of the milk, mixing with a fouet.</p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Maybe even if you leave it in a low fire, some clogs will be formed. To get rid of them, filter the cream through a <em>sieve</em> (peneira).</p>
     <!-- A good idea is to do this part after the whites as it is served best warm. -->
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 6:</strong> Now that both components are finished, it's time to present the desserts. First take the amount of bowls of how many desserts you want to make and divide the yolk cream equally into each one. Then, carefully remove each white island from the parchment paper and place one in each bowl. If some are left, just put two of them in one. </p>
     <p class="step"><strong>Step 7 (optional):</strong> If you want to give this dessert a more interesting taste, some suggestions are to sprinkle some cinnamon, pour some liquid caramel or add some almonds! Enjoy!</p>
